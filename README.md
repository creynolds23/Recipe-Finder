# Overview
In this project, I created a web application called "Recipe Finder" to demonstrate my skills in JavaScript programming. This project aims to provide users with a simple tool to search for recipes based on ingredients and cuisine preferences. My goal was to further my learning of JavaScript and web development by building a functional and user-friendly application
